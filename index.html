            <p>Hi! I'm Steven Cresswell and, after being fascinated with the field for years, I'm at the start of my career in coding. With a background in Commercial Archaeology and Secondary Science Education, I'm bringing a variety of experiences to the field.</p>
            <p>Currently, I'm focussed on exploring a career as a front-end developer and have been developing the relevant skills to that end.</p>
            <p>In my spare time I'm an avid gamer, enjoyer of nature, father of twins, and I help my wife run her ecological consultancy business. Occasionally, I sleep!</p>
